1. Introduction

Bulk Update Custom Field Options (“the App”) is a Jira Cloud app built using the Atlassian Forge platform. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data when installed and used within your Jira Cloud environment.

By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

2. Data Collection

The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data outside of your Atlassian Cloud instance.

The App only processes the following Jira configuration data within your Jira site:

Custom Field IDs

Context IDs

Custom Field Option values (text values provided by the Jira administrator)

No user profile information, email addresses, or issue content is collected.

3. Data Storage

The App does not use external servers or databases.

All processing is performed within Atlassian’s Forge runtime (inside Atlassian’s infrastructure).

No data is persisted beyond the scope of the operation requested (e.g., adding, removing, or disabling field options).

4. Data Sharing

The App does not share any data with third parties.

The App only communicates with the Jira Cloud REST API via the Atlassian Forge platform.

5. Security

The App relies on Atlassian Forge’s secure execution environment.

Permissions are strictly limited to those required for functionality:

manage:jira-configuration

read:field.option:jira

write:field.option:jira

6. User Consent

By installing and using the App, you consent to the processing of Jira configuration data strictly for the purposes of managing custom field options.
